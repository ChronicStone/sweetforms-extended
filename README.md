# sweetforms-extended
Sweetforms extended is a project that intends to take Sweetforms to a whole other level. The tool willl still use Sweetalert as a base, but all the form components will be built using StencilJs and WebComponents.

The ultimate goal is to provide a high-quality, scalable and available form generator, compatible with most frontend frameworks and browsers.
